Despite efforts to control it, TB continues to threaten human lives, especially in developing countries, for over four millennia. It spreads through airborne transmission from person to person.\n\n**Objective**: This study aimed to examine the determinants of active TB, exploring the variations in incidence by gender, age group, and country within the Eastern Africa region.\n\n**Methods**: A descriptive correlational research design was employed under the positivist paradigm. Aggregated secondary TB data from the World Health Organization (WHO) database was used, with a sample size of 656 cases across Eastern Africa. Data analysis included both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques to investigate the relationships between TB incidences and risk factors.\n\n**Results**: Results showed that individuals aged 65 and older are most vulnerable to TB infection. Patients with HIV were found to be particularly at risk due to weakened immune systems, with diabetic patients also more likely to develop TB than smokers. Smokers were twice as likely to develop TB as undernourished individuals, while alcohol consumption was found to have a lesser impact on TB susceptibility than undernourishment. Mozambique, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda were identified as the countries with the highest TB burden in 2018.\n\n**Conclusions**: The findings provide insights into the TB epidemic in East Africa and offer data for governments to enhance control, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies.\n\n**Keywords**: Tuberculosis, incidence, prevalence, Eastern Africa\n\n# Introduction\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a severe infectious disease primarily affecting the lungs, though it can also spread to the kidneys, spine, brain, and intestines (Zaman, 2010). For over 4,000 years, TB has posed a significant health challenge globally, and recent reports indicate that it remains the leading cause of death from infectious diseases, surpassing HIV/AIDS (WHO, 2019). In 2018, more than 10 million people were diagnosed with active TB worldwide, with 1.5 million deaths attributed to the disease.\n\nIn Eastern Africa, TB remains prevalent, particularly among men (57% of cases), followed by women (32%) and children (1.1%) (WHO, 2019). Poverty, malnutrition, and limited access to healthcare exacerbate TB in this region, leading to high incidence rates (Kenya Ministry of Health, 2016). Understanding the social, demographic, and biological factors influencing TB transmission is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.\n\nThis study investigates the determinants of TB incidence across Eastern Africa, focusing on variations by gender, age group, and country.\n\n# Methods\n\n## Study Design and Data Source\n\nThis descriptive correlational study used secondary data from the WHO TB database. The data consisted of 656 aggregated TB cases reported across 19 Eastern African countries in 2018. A positivist approach was employed, and the study focused on identifying relationships between TB incidences and potential risk factors.\n\n## Sampling Procedure\n\nThe study employed purposive sampling to select the Eastern African countries and variables most relevant to the research questions. Excluded from the analysis were countries outside the Eastern African region and variables not contributing to the research objectives.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Inferential analysis, including two-sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and negative binomial regression, was performed using R software to test the study's hypotheses and examine the relationship between TB and various risk factors such as HIV, diabetes, alcohol, smoking, and malnutrition.\n\n## Hypotheses\n\n1.  **H1**: Males have significantly higher TB incidence than females in Eastern Africa.\n2.  **H2**: The elderly (65 years and older) experience higher TB incidence across Eastern Africa.\n3.  **H3**: There is a significant association between TB risk factors (HIV, diabetes, smoking, alcohol, malnutrition) and estimated TB cases in Eastern Africa.\n\n# Results\n\n## Demographic Information\n\n| Gender | Mean     | SD       | Median | Min | Max    |\n|--------|----------|----------|--------|-----|--------|\n| Female | 6412.93  | 13950.22 | 1500   | 0   | 99000  |\n| Male   | 10781.98 | 24689.67 | 1900   | 0   | 165000 |\n\n: Descriptive Statistics by Gender\n\nMales were more susceptible to TB, with a higher mean incidence (M=10781.98, SD=24689.67) than females (M=6412.93, SD=13950.22).\n\n## Age Groups and Risk Factors\n\n| Age Group | Mean     | SD       | Median | Min | Max    |\n|-----------|----------|----------|--------|-----|--------|\n| 65-74     | 19249.09 | 32252.61 | 3400   | 0   | 165000 |\n| 15-24     | 8120.57  | 20197.04 | 1000   | 0   | 146000 |\n\n: Descriptive Statistics by Age Group\n\nIndividuals aged 65-74 were the most affected, with a mean of 19249.09 cases (SD=32252.61), while young adults (15-24) were the second-highest risk group.\n\n## Inferential Analysis\n\n### H1: Males and TB Incidence\n\nA two-sample t-test revealed that males had significantly higher TB incidence than females (t = -2.89, p = 0.002).\n\n### H2: Age and TB Incidence\n\nOne-way ANOVA showed a significant difference in TB incidence across age groups (F(6, 649) = 11.19, p \\< 0.001), with the elderly experiencing the highest burden.\n\n### H3: Risk Factors\n\nNegative binomial regression indicated that individuals with HIV (RR=2.43, p=0.002), smoking (RR=2.38, p=0.003), and diabetes (RR=1.92, p=0.029) were at significantly higher risk of developing TB.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThis study confirms that males and the elderly are more susceptible to TB infection in Eastern Africa. It also highlights the importance of addressing HIV, diabetes, and smoking as critical risk factors. Similar to previous research (Ravikumar & Varadaraja, 2017; Berkowitz, 2017), HIV patients were identified as the most vulnerable group, with their weakened immune systems exacerbating TB risk.\n\nThe findings provide a foundation for governments in Eastern Africa to enhance TB prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies, particularly for at-risk populations such as the elderly, men, and individuals with comorbid conditions like HIV and diabetes.\n\n# References\n\nBerkowitz, N.
