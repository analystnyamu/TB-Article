# Results

Out of a total of 621 tuberculosis (TB) patients, 60% were male, with the majority of cases (37%) concentrated in individuals between 15 and 20 years of age. Additionally, 15% of the TB patients were over 65 years old, indicating that both younger and older populations are significantly impacted by the disease, though with different demographic patterns.


The analysis further revealed that co-infections and lifestyle factors were prominent among TB patients. Approximately 37% of the TB patients were HIV-positive, highlighting the interplay between immunosuppression and susceptibility to TB. Furthermore, 26% of the TB patients were smokers, indicating that smoking is a substantial risk factor in TB development.
